Hi there!
My name is Markus Grech and I'm a software engineer from Vienna, Austria, currently working on their Master's degree.
I'm interested in high-performance software, CPU architectures, compilers and programming language design.

### Recent Projects

- **javaopc** (bachelor's thesis): A compiler implementing an operator overloading extension for the Java programming language
- **Katana**: A new native programming language; supports user-defined operators, limited compile-time execution and gives more control to the programmer than C++
- **CIJ**: A compiler and virtual machine with both interpreter and JIT backends for a subset of the Java programming language; VM written from scratch (no libraries beyond the C++ stdlib)
- **oc-memtest**: A small tool for quickly validating memory overclocks under Windows
